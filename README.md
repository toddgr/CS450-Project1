# CS450-Project1
Draw something cool in 3D. Introduction to Computer Graphics Project

This project requires you to draw something fun in 3D. It must be of your own creation. You can use pre-canned 3D objects, such as the ones that GLUT provides, in addition to your own, but you must also create your own geometry.
* You can explicitly list your own 3D coordinates, or you can use equations and define the 3D shapes procedurally.
* You must have at least 100 x-y-z coordinates. These can be divided up among multiple of your objects.
* You must use at least 5 different colors.
* The 3D rotation and scaling from the sample program must still be working.
